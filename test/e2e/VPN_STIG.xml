                &lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Unrestricted traffic may contain malicious traffic
                which poses a threat to an enclave or to other connected networks. Additionally,
                unrestricted traffic may transit a network, which uses bandwidth and other
                resources. VPN traffic received from another enclave with different security policy
                or level of trust must not bypass be inspected by the firewall before being

                &lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Display of a standardized and approved use
                notification before granting access to the network ensures privacy and security
                notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive
                Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. In most VPN
                implementations, the banner is configured in the management backplane (NDM SRG) and
                serves as the presentation for the VPN client connection as well as for
                administrator logon to the device management tool/backplane. System use
                notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and
                are not required when such human interfaces do not exist. This requirement applies
                to VPN gateways that have the concept of a user account and have the logon function
                residing on the VPN gateway. The banner must be formatted in accordance with
                applicable DoD policy. Use the following verbiage for VPN gateways that can
                accommodate banners of 1300 characters: "You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG)
                Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this

                have severe limitations on the number of characters that can be displayed in the
                banner: "I've read &amp; consent to terms in IS user
